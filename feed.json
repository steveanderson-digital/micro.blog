This film was made as orientation for new employees who would need to use the computer center, and this, part 2 of 2 (see part 1), is about the programming center within the HOCC.\nOne thing that’s notable about this film — different from Part 1 — is the preponderance of women working in the Programmer Services area. Around 1966, 7 years before this film was made, there were over 500 women working in “technical work” at Bell Labs, rather than administrative work, and many were in computing. A book and blog by Nathan Ensmenger examines the sociological history of computing, and why during the 1980s the computing field became more and more the province of men. Stories about women in the early decades of computing still reside in the world of the personal anecdote; it’s hard to assess the exact data on how many women worked in the field in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The original video isn’t available on the Wayback Machine, but the YouTube version is embedded below.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9aVOIuKVUc?si=lPxHj7RTc_hu2qKo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\n<p>(Originally published on my old site, “The Digital Imaginary” [imaginary.digital], on February 17th, 2015 – revised and republished April 2nd, 2025.)</p>\n",

In 1973, UNIX as a system was limited to installations on DEC computers, and there were UNIX installations at other locations of Bell Laboratories such as Indian Hill, Whippany, and, of course, Murray Hill (where UNIX and C were developed).\nComputers in the Bell System weren't just relegated to computer science or the development of computer language.

If its usefulness lies in the promotion of ongoing creative thinking, then, once that thinking is finished, the paper becomes superfluous. The solution to our paper problem, they write, is not to use less paper but to keep less paper. Why bother filing at all? Everything we know about the workplace suggests that few if any knowledge workers ever refer to documents again once they have filed them away, which should come as no surprise, since paper is a lousy way to archive information. It’s too hard to search and it takes up too much space. Besides, we all have the best filing system ever invented, right there on our desks — the personal computer. That is the irony of the P.C.: the workplace problem that it solves is the nineteenth-century anxiety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Originally published on my old site, “The Digital Imaginary” [imaginary.digital], on February 10th, 2015 – revised and republished April 3rd, 2025.)</p>\n",

Of course, this is a time when very few people had driver’s licenses, so the birth certificate was the key document. The US didn’t achieve universal birth registration until 1933, however, and in 1942 the Census Bureau estimated that 40 percent of Americans still lacked birth certificates. So the State Department required those without birth certificates to get sworn statements from one of three people who was deemed to have been able to witness the birth: the mother, a doctor, or a midwife. And if none of those three were available, a friend who was a US citizen had to vouch for your citizenship. So you were no longer seen as a reliable source of your own identity. You needed someone else to verify it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><img title=\"fred-soper-passport-history.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/215146/2025/fred-soper-passport-history.jpg\" alt=\"Fred Soper US passport 1920.\" width=\"550\" height=\"783\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>United States Passport for American epidemiologist, Fred Soper, 1920. <a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/vv/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101584650X86-img\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Library of Medicine revised 2025 link, image doesn't seem to load</a>. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110612022723/http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/VVBBGC.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wayback Machine link for image</a>.</p>\n<p>(Originally published on my old site, “The Digital Imaginary” [imaginary.digital], on February 9th, 2015 – revised and republished April 3rd, 2025.)</p>\n",

But it’s representative of an emerging body of work that might be called “paperwork studies.” True, there are not yet any dedicated journals or conferences. But in history, anthropology, literature and media studies departments and beyond, a group of loosely connected scholars are taking a fresh look at office memos, government documents and corporate records, not just for what they say but also for how they circulate and the sometimes unpredictable things they do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Originally published on my old site, “The Digital Imaginary” [imaginary.digital], on February 9th, 2015 – revised and republished April 3rd, 2025.)</p>\n",

The threat, of course, is that we are being overwhelmed by paperwork’s proliferation, its explosion — a threat that historian Ann Blair has recently traced through the early modern period. The wish is to convert all this cumbersome matter into liberating energy, which is exactly what explosions do. From Chaptal’s “electric fluid” to IBM’s “Machines Should Work, People Should Think” to USA.gov’s “Government Made Easy,” we remain attached to the idea that someday, somehow, we can liberate this energy, put it to other uses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The “liberating energy” that Kafka speaks of also requires containment, it needs direction and control, services which IBM was ready to supply.</p>\n<p>Two other aspects of paperwork which I’m researching are: (1) the degree to which IBM was instigating the “paperwork explosion” itself, where was it coming from, who else was worried about it, and (2) how the militaristic response to the demands of paperwork figure into the Cold War environment.</p>\n",
