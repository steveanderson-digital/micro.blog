This film was made as orientation for new employees who would need to use the computer center, and this, part 2 of 2 (see part 1), is about the programming center within the HOCC.\nOne thing that's notable about this film — different from Part 1 — is the preponderance of women working in the Programmer Services area. Around 1966, 7 years before this film was made, there were over 500 women working in \"technical work\" at Bell Labs, rather than administrative work, and many were in computing. A book and blog by Nathan Ensmenger examines the sociological history of computing, and why during the 1980s the computing field became more and more the province of men. Stories about women in the early decades of computing still reside in the world of the personal anecdote; it's hard to assess the exact data on how many women worked in the field in the 1960s and 1970s.</blockquote>\n",

And as the 1973 Holmdel Computer Center only had IBM computers, it wasn't running a UNIX installation: the system was only ported to IBM computers in the years to come. In 1973, UNIX as a system was limited to installations on DEC computers, and there were UNIX installations at other locations of Bell Laboratories such as Indian Hill, Whippany, and, of course, Murray Hill (where UNIX and C were developed).\nComputers in the Bell System weren't just relegated to computer science or the development of computer language. They were employed for all kinds of complex engineering calculations, telecommunications applications, and, very occasionally, for making art and music.</blockquote>\n",

If its usefulness lies in the promotion of ongoing creative thinking, then, once that thinking is finished, the paper becomes superfluous. The solution to our paper problem, they write, is not to use less paper but to keep less paper. Why bother filing at all? Everything we know about the workplace suggests that few if any knowledge workers ever refer to documents again once they have filed them away, which should come as no surprise, since paper is a lousy way to archive information. It’s too hard to search and it takes up too much space. Besides, we all have the best filing system ever invented, right there on our desks — the personal computer. That is the irony of the P.C.: the workplace problem that it solves is the nineteenth-century anxiety.</blockquote>\n",

Of course, this is a time when very few people had driver’s licenses, so the birth certificate was the key document. The US didn’t achieve universal birth registration until 1933, however, and in 1942 the Census Bureau estimated that 40 percent of Americans still lacked birth certificates. So the State Department required those without birth certificates to get sworn statements from one of three people who was deemed to have been able to witness the birth: the mother, a doctor, or a midwife. And if none of those three were available, a friend who was a US citizen had to vouch for your citizenship. So you were no longer seen as a reliable source of your own identity. You needed someone else to verify it.</blockquote>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_40\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"550\"]<a href=\"http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/VV/p-visuals/true\"><img class=\"wp-image-40 size-full\" src=\"http://digitalimaginary.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fred-soper-passport-history.jpg\" alt=\"United States Passport for Fred Soper, 1920 (via National Library of Medicine)\" width=\"550\" height=\"783\"></a> United States Passport for American epidemiologist, Fred Soper, 1920 (via <a href=\"http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/VV/p-visuals/true\">National Library of Medicine</a>)[/caption]\n",
