<p>There seems to be a consistent problem with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;glaze.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It seems, though, that glaze is a purposeful attribute &ndash; the problem isn&rsquo;t that there is glaze, it&rsquo;s that it glazes &ldquo;too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Frommer also mentions in the podcast (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->1:25:43<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), &ldquo;I try to use the default settings for almost everything, just so I feel like I&rsquo;m experiencing technology the way that, like, most people are experiencing it.&rdquo; And I agree, the default setting, the vanilla, can be really interesting.

<p>Frustration with computers may be familiar to us now, but in the late 1960s and early 1970s it reached a new level.</p>
<p>The general public was aware that computers, or &ldquo;mainframes,&rdquo; were impacting their lives, but they had little recourse and no access to their own information within computerized systems. Which isn&rsquo;t far removed from the present, actually, considering search engines, social media, and AI.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that the man wielding the sledgehammer doesn&rsquo;t give his name &ndash; he&rsquo;s simply a number in the eyes of the computer.</p>

<p>I was listening to <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Talk Show<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with John Gruber and guest Jason Snell<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and they mentioned the recent news about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon Prosser being sued by Apple for the alleged theft of trade secrets related to iOS 26<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>This reminded me of the 2017 news story about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an Apple engineer&rsquo;s daughter filming the iPhone X on a visit to Apple Park in Cupertino<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And of course, there was also the 2010 scandal of a prototype iPhone 4 being left in a bar:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In his 2010 WWDC keynote address, Steve Jobs announced the iPhone 4 and remarked, &ldquo;Now&hellip;stop me if you&rsquo;ve already seen this,&rdquo; to which the audience knowingly laughed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple&rsquo;s renewed focus on preventing leaks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, they still seem to be in the ether. I wonder if Apple&rsquo;s expansion of production to other countries will make preventing leaks more difficult. At times, however, some of the info seems to be streaming from in and around Cupertino. Personally, I just like to wait and see what Apple announces (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->and actually ships<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) before making a decision to upgrade.</p>

			 <p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new Apple Pro Display XDR is being rumored<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I hope the price comes down, for the display and its accessories.</p>
<p>I remember watching the Apple WWDC Keynote in 2019, and there were some &ldquo;boos&rdquo; when the pricing for the display&rsquo;s semi-optional Pro Stand was announced ($999 just for the stand). In my memory, I feel like the boos were louder during the live-streamed event than in the recorded version (the applause seems the same).

<p>A <!-- raw HTML omitted -->new Studio Display is also rumored<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and hopefully the camera quality will be upgraded<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A higher refresh rate would be a welcome addition too, especially for gaming.</p>
<p>What would also be nice, would be a lower-tier Apple display, designed for those with Mac minis and general computing needs. This would be like the 15-inch MacBook Air, filling a need (for quality displays &ndash; no more creaky plastic monitors), and also introducing more folks to Apple&rsquo;s integration between software and hardware.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was listening to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ATP podcast<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Siracusa<!-- raw HTML omitted --> discussed &ldquo;Coyote Time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of Coyote Time comes from Wile E. Coyote cartoons, and it&rsquo;s rooted in video game design.</p>
<p>In the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Wile E. Coyote tends to end up just off the edge of a cliff, but he doesn&rsquo;t fall until he realizes his dire situation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At a glance, it would appear that Coyote Time is a moment of realization, a sinking feeling of impending doom. However, in video game design, Coyote Time is more about forgiveness and empathetic design choices. Coyote Time is about designing features into a game that provide a sense of reality apart from the harsh mechanics of the game itself.</p>
<p>In, &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Coyote Time: What Games can Teach Us About Forgiveness in Learning<!-- raw HTML omitted -->,&rdquo; Eva Grouling Snider describes Coyote Time as providing &ldquo;wiggle room&rdquo; and reducing frustration, which helps to &ldquo;minimize the consequences of errors, mistakes, and imperfections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In educational design and video game design, Coyote Time can be relied on for applying both reality and unreality, a sense of authenticity or inauthenticity, with the end goal of providing engaging experiences where the student, or player, is able to perform at their best.</p>
<p>For example, in video games, this is often a bit of lag introduced purposefully to enable the player to perform an action, such as jumping over a difficult object. In teaching, this could be a low-stakes formative assessment, or perhaps a quiz that can be taken multiple times but only saving the highest score. In lower division courses, Coyote Time may be increased, and then gradually designed out of the course for upper division or graduate level work.</p>
<p>In teaching, Coyote Time can be explicit, for example, allowing drafts to be submitted for comments prior to the formal essay. Coyote Time can also be implicit, in that it&rsquo;s designed into the course and woven through the educational pathways, providing layers of support while not necessarily stating the design choices.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;mop and pail&rdquo; in the computer room were a constant theme for mainframes in the late 1950s and 1960s. In this cartoon the &ldquo;it&rdquo; is unclear, which is part of the humor.

			 <p>&ldquo;No dialogue ever, except &ldquo;Beep-Beep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took this photo at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Museum of the Moving Image<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Astoria, New York, eleven years ago.

<p>Jason Kottke also posted &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Rules of Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote Cartoons<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; around the same time, in 2012 (a vintage post). The two versions are pretty close!</p>

<p>When thinking of AI, it seems there are no rules at the moment. The game is being played while the rules are being made.</p>

<p>The slow roll-outs of Alexa+ and Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;new&rdquo; Siri and Apple Intelligence are related to the complexity of LLMs and AI, especially in wide release to the general public. Tech companies are realizing that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;last mile is a lot farther away than they anticipated.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> It&rsquo;s one thing to have an extra pack of kitchen sponges delivered, and another for a mainframe computer to show up on the doorstep.</p>

			 <p>We&rsquo;re in TDF: Unchained! We finished watching Tour de France: Unchained on Netflix, and we&rsquo;re in the last episode in Nice! We&rsquo;re blurry figures on the side of the road during the time trial, but still there ☺️ (S3: E8).</p>
<p>I took this video of Tadej Pogačar at the time trial. The video was taken with a DJI Osmo Pocket 3 in slow motion, but slow motion video doesn&rsquo;t include audio. So I used my iPhone to record ambient sound, and then synced the video and audio together with Final Cut Pro on Mac.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m enjoying the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple TV series, &ldquo;Murderbot.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The mix of &ldquo;green world&rdquo; (organic and open), and &ldquo;closed world&rdquo; (artificial and enclosed) are quite prevalent, even in the mind of Murderbot himself: [1]</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“I could just leave them to cope on their own, I guess. But it wasn’t that easy. It’s wrong to think of constructs like me as half-bot, half-organic. Like the bot-half should just want to obey orders and do its job. And the organic part should want to protect itself and get the hell out of there. As opposed to the reality. Which was that I was one, whole confused entity.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (S1: E7 at 13:22, Murderbot internal dialogue)</p>
<p>And in the next episode:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;I was trying to calm myself down with some of my favorite episodes. But I couldn’t focus. It was like this new show, “Murderbot: And Its Selfish Ungrateful Hippie Clients,” had just taken over.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (S1: E8 at 22:39, Murderbot internal dialogue)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d share some screenshots of the show, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but sadly, screenshots are disabled on Apple devices<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There are some workarounds though, and here&rsquo;s the trailer:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Note that the trailer is from YouTube. It would be nice if Apple TV shows and movies could be embedded from Apple TV, without all the ads and other nonsense.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
